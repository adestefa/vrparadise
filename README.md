# VR Paradise

# What is it?
A simple game using elements and features I have learned studying Unity3D 5, Blender and C#.

# How do I play?
You find yourself on a tiny island. Get in the boat, figure out how to start, then collect as many red blocks before the timer runs out.


# Controls
Keyboard/mouse, gamepad
